Objective: This Shiny R code creates an interactive dashboard that visualizes ecological data collected by Rare. The Dashboard can be used by Rare staff to easily explore ecological data that is being currently collected by country teams and can create reports.

The R code is divided in three files, ui.r, server.r and eco_dashboard.r. You will need to run the three files to create the dashboard
The dashboard can be already accessed here https://abelvaldivia.shinyapps.io/shinnyapp/ 

NOTE: this is a working progress and I am currently updating the R code to add more features to the dashboard. Thus, many lines of code are currently unactive (i.e., # ).
